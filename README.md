# ROCK MUSIC GENERATION! 
In this project, we used a long short-term memory model (LSTM) to first learn the structure of individual rock music instrument tracks, and we generated basis tracks from these. Songs were made by putting this basis track through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to “classify” a given instrument with labels for others (e.g. a generated bass track would yield a classified guitar track), leading to cohesive instrumentation.
